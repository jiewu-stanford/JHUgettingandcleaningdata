# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

### Description
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.


### Variables
The subjects are coded from 1 to 30. The activities are coded from 1 to 6 and are then labeled with names during the processing. The measurement (the feature variable) has three attributes (1) what kind of measurement e.g. body acceleration or jerk (2) what type of statistical data i.e. mean or standard deviation (3) what is the axis the measurement was made i.e. X or Y or Z.
